Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors - An implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, 
Scissors game, from The Odin Project curriculum

This project will be a basic implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors
game achieved through the use of the many JavaScript concepts learned so far in
the curriculum. Functions and loops, along with the primitive values and many of
the other basic concepts of the language will be used to complete this implementation
of the game.

By the end of this project, I expect to have a better perspective of the workflow
that is needed to complete a simple project that includes JavaScript code, as
well as have experience in building a simple implementation of a game from scratch,
given that this is the first project made through The Odin Project curriculum
that will use JavaScript. I will also put into practice some of the problem
solving techniques I have learned so far in my endeavor to implement the game
of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

A user interface will also be implemented, making use of older concepts learned
in HTML and CSS, as well as newer concepts learned about manipulating the DOM
and handling events with JavaScript in order to add dynamic behavior to a website.
